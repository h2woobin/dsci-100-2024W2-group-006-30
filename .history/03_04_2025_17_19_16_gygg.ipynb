    "2. Firstly, I used a `filter` function and an argument !is.na to extract the gender's column rows in the merged data frame and find the values which are not NA.\n",
    "3. In addition, using the `select` function to choose which columns I can use in this research, I choose name, gender, start time and end time columns to solve this research. Name and gender columns can help us know each player's names and which gender are they. Also, start time and end time columns can help us know how long they spent on game.\n",
    "4. Thirdly, using `group_by` and `summarize` functions to split the gender column to each column and make a column name total_sessions and calculate each column to find values.\n",
    "5. Last but not least, using the `ggplot` function to create a bar chart and find the total distribution for each genders.\n",
    "6. Finally, the bar shows the most, least and middle contributed for each genders. *Male* gender contributed most for this game which is in the upper 1000. *Other* gender contributed least for this game which is almost 0. Besides, second place is *Female*, third place is *Non-binary*, fourth place is *Prefer not to say*, fifth place is *Agender* and sixth place is *Two-Spirited*.\n",
    "7. OVerall, I described the number of players related to gender and contribution from players for the game, so the most distributed is *Male* players and the least distributed is *Other* players."

This step allowed me to quantify differences in playtime between subscribed and non-subscribed users. To visualize these differences, I created a bar plot, with subscription status on the x-axis and average played hours on the y-axis. The bars were color-filled according to subscription status, and appropriate axis labels and a title were added to enhance readability.

    "According to the diagram of the four small questions, players in 20 and 20 to 30 years old contributed the most to game time, followed by players between 30 and 50 years old, and players with the shortest game time in 50 years and older. Compared to all other experience levels, the average player spends more time playing than the pro player averages on top of the game time. In terms of the impact of gender on the game, male gamers have contributed to the game for the longest time, even far more than other players. While some of the results are not far from the predicted, pros spend less time playing than the average gamer, suggesting that pro gamers are more focused on mastering the game than on the amount of time they spend playing. These findings provide suggestions and ideas for planning and adjusting the direction of the game, as well as studying user retention. Future developments can focus on how to adjust better decisions to make games accessible to different ages."

    "Through our analysis, we found that certain types of player are strongly linked to higher engagement levels, which directly correlates with greater data contribution. Players in their 20s and 30s tend to spend the most time per session, suggesting that age influences how long players engage with the game at one session. Interestingly, while we expected more experienced players to play more, the data showed that \"Regular\" players had the highest overall playtime, indicating they may be the most engaged group. In terms of gender, male players had the highest number of total sessions, followed by female and non-binary players, meaning male players contributed the most session-based data. Also, we found that subscribed players played significantly more than non-subscribers, confirming that subscription is a strong indicator of player engagement and data contribution."
